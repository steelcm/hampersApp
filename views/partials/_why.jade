			p "I spend more time at Borough Market than anywhere else conducting my exclusive tours, which I've been running since 2007. Borough is unique in the Universe - absolute foodie Nirvana. I am connected and engaged continuously with the Market traders and their stunning array of gourmet food and drink products - constantly tasting, comparing, matching and discovering. 
			p "I have personally selected my definitive collection of Borough's finest foodie treasures and hidden gems, bringing them together in one dream package for the first time. 
			p "Buying these unique luxury hampers supports small artisan producers and traders, not big retailers or corporations. Quality and provenance is assured. 
			p "The hampers contain my secret ingredients and store cupboard must-haves for creating mind-blowing flavour sensations at home. This awesome box of tricks includes a how-to guide I've written to show you how to craft magic with the hamper's contents. Such as:
			ul
				li Simple, healthy condiments that transform potatoes, vegetables, poultry, fish and shellfish
				li Miracle workers from breakfast to cocktails
				li The Ultimate all-purpose flavour enhancer
				li Nibbles to accompany a fine bottle of English wine (wine included, of course)
				li Stunning finishing touches for steak, salad or risotto - even ice cream or fruit!"
